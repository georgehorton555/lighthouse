<h1> Software Development and Cloud Computing Overview</h1>

<br>

<h2> Agile framework for software development</h2>

<p>
Agile software development describes an approach to software development under <br
which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of <br>
self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end users(s).[1] <br>
It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, <br>
and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to <br>
change.[2]

<h2> Scrum (software development)</h2>
<p>
Scrum is an agile framework for managing work with an emphasis on software development. <br>
It is designed for teams of three to nine developers who break their work into actions <br>
that can be completed within timeboxed iterations, called sprints (typically two-weeks) <br>
and track progress and re-plan in 15-minute stand-up meetings, called daily scrums

<h2> git - fast version control</h2>
<p>
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed <br>
to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

 <h3>Software as a service (SaaS)</h3>

<p>SaaS is also known as "on-demand software". Users of SaaS rather than <br>
fully buy the license of various software hire the software at regular intervals<br>
and use it through an Internet browser. The variety of software provided by SaaS is very broad. <br>
There are a number of software used by SaaS from companies such as ezTalks Video Conferencing <br>
that employs in content management, human resources management, accounting, ERP, <br>
customer relationship management and other relevant areas.</p>

 <h3>Platform as a service (PaaS)</h3>

<p>PaaS provides computers platforms for users of cloud computing. It is also the link between <br>
the other twoservices provided by cloud computing; SaaS and IaaS.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)</h3>

<p>IaaS is the third type of computing across the cloud. Just like PaaS and SaaS, different <br>
software and hardware devices deliver on a cloud platform, while IaaS provides a virtualized <br>
platform. The process of hardware virtualization shows the users only the abstract computing <br>
platform instead of the physical functions. Such virtualization results in the creation of aso-called <br>
"virtual machine monitor" or "hypervisor", which is the creation of the third part of the <br>
cloud computing, i. Interface as a service. <br> <br>
